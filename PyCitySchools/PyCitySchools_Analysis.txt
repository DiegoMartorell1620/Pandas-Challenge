PyCitySchools Analysis

In this analysis of 15 different schools and 39170 students we can observe that the average reading and math scores are close to 80, which is not a bad grade. However, when we analyze the grades by school, we can observe that some schools have a much better performance than others and surprisingly, there is not a relationship between how much funding these schools received and how well their students did in the tests. For example, we have Bailey High School with a budget per student of $628 and despite that, they have lower scores than Holden High School or Pena High School both with budgets of $581 and $609 per student respectively.

There is however a strong relationship between the type of school and the grades of their students. Charter Schools have an average of 90% of their students passing both their math and reading tests. On the other hand, District Schools have an average of around 50% of their students passing both tests. Therefore, we can conclude that Charter Schools are using their budget more efficiently since they are producing better results than their counterparts.

Another conclusion that can be drawn from the analysis is that students from smaller schools tend to have a much better performance than their peers from larger schools. Around 90% of students from Small and Middle size schools are passing both tests whereas only 58% of students from Large Schools are passing their reading and math tests. Of course, this is also related to the fact that most medium and small sized school are Charter Schools and most District Schools are much larger.

Lastly, from the analysis it can be observed that students from District Schools have on average a passing grade when it comes to their reading tests. However, when it comes to their math tests there is actually problematic results. Therefore, this subject should be reinforced or probably different teaching methods should be used when it comes to teaching math in District Schools.
